## ⚙️ Installation and Runtime

1️⃣ Install Dependencies

    npm install

2️⃣ Launch json-server

    npx json-server --watch db.json --port 3000

This will expose the mock API at:

    http://localhost:3000/

3️⃣ Serve the SPA
Open index.html directly or

🌐 Main Routes
Home / Dashboard (authenticated): /dashboard.html

Create Event (admin): /dashboard/events/create.html

Edit Event (admin): /dashboard/events/edit.html

Page not found: /not-found.html

If a visitor attempts to access administrative routes, they will be redirected to not-found.html.

If an authenticated user attempts to access /login.html or /register.html, they will be redirected to /dashboard.html.
